Description: An R package for reading, cleaning, reducing, analysis, and 
    visualization of telemetry observation data. The package is being 
    initially build using radio telemetry data from a project to characterize
    the distribution, movement, and survival of juvenile Chinook salmon in 
    the Lemhi and Salmon rivers, Idaho, during winter months. Tools 
    include the cleaning and reduction of data to prepare capture histories 
    for a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model and also to evaluate the habitat 
    availability and use to describe preferred or target habitat conditions. 
    Our hope is to build the package with functions and tools that can be 
    applied elsewhere to telemetry or similar observational datasets.
